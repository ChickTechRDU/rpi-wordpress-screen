#Welcome to the ChickTech kickoff!

##Icebreaker
To get to know each other, lets quickly go around the room.  When it is your turn state:

- Your name
- School you go to
- What your programming and sysadmin excerince is
- Something you like that starts with the first letter of your first name

I'll start.
My name is Dustin.  I've been working in IT as a sysadmin for 15 years now.  I like death metal.


## Intros

Now that the icebreaker is done, we want to tell you a bit more about ourselves and the company we work for.  We hope that this will give you a better idea about what people actually do in IT and steer you towards the person you need to talk to if a specific thing we do in our lab interests you.

We all work at a company named Red Hat.  Red Hat is an open source software company.  This means the software we develop is free for anybody to use and improve.  We believe that when people work together, instead of in competition with against one another, great things happen.

Red Hats core product is a version of Linux.  Linux is an Operating System similar to macOS or Windows but is primarily used by servers and not laptops and home pcs. Most of the websites you visit are powered by Linux, Android phones are powered by Linux, nearly all super computers are powered by Linux -- our presense is everywhere, even if you haven't heard of us before today.  Red Hat also offers OpenShift which is an orchestration and management layer on top of Docker like containers and OpenStack which is an alternative to Amazon AWS could as well as tons of other things.

Red Hat is a GREAT company to work for.  It is full of passonate and diverse people with all kinds of skillsets.  Everybody is always willing to pitch in and help in anyway they can despite any formal job duties like those listed above.  The work environment is casual (no fancy clothes, heiarchy means nothing) and fun. There are meetup style groups and events happening on a regular basis.

##Objective
Have you ever been to a concert or a sporting event where they put tweets on the jumbotron(big screen)?

What about watched the news or a TV show where they are displaying a facebook post and are discussing it?

Over the next two days we will be building something similar!

With a Raspberry Pi, Wordpress, some python code and an LCD screen you will be able to post to your blog and see it on your screen.

##Adding the hardware

The prolilferation of technology, Moore's law and the golablization of the labor force over the last few decades has changed things in interesting ways. Things used to be expensive and mechnical.  Now they are cheap and electronic.

Below is a contrived example that will help drive home the point I'm trying to make.

A water heater from 20 years ago:

- Had one water setting: on/off
- A bouy would float on top of water in the tank. Once it rose past a certain trip point a switch would flip and the water heater wouldn't collect anymore water.
- Cost $1000 in todays money
- A mechanic/hacker/enthusiast could replace the bouy or physically lower or higher the trip point as fixes/improvements. These would all be cost effective actions that the general public could understand.

A water heater 15 years ago:

- Had two simple settings
- Was controlled by simple electronic componets (resistors, capacitors, timers, etc)
- Cost $700 in todays money
- A mechanic/hacker/enthusiast could replace an electronic component by desoldering it and soldering in a new one.  They could determine which componenets were bad by using a basic multi-meter.


A water heater today:

- Can use a calendar schedule
- Can use enviromental presets
- Can react based on gallons dispersed to encourage flat rate bills
- Can email you if there is a problem
- Cost $300
- A mechanic/hacker/enthusiast just sees a bunch of chips when the open up the water heater.  They don't know how it works.  Calling a repair person isn't worth the money because replacing the whole device will likely be cheaper.


As devices have gotten "SMART"er more and more electronic components have been needed.  In the past a TV factory would partner with a microcontroller or processor manufacturer and something custom would be fabricated for their use case. This took a long time and cost a considerable amount of money.  And while that still happens, now days exteremly common electronic componets are mass produced and sold on the open market for cheap.  Component vendors now compete to document their components and make them as generic and easy to get and use as possible.

This commoditization of electronic compontes has opened up a new door for hackers.  They can now build their own simplistic SMART devices using off the shelf parts and open source IDEs.  Today we will be hooking up a $8 LCD screen to our Raspberry Pi's and using open source libraries to play with it.

The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ has 40 GPIO (general purpose input/output pins). The pinout looks like
![pinout](https://gitlab.corp.redhat.com/dminnich/2019-chicktech/raw/master/pi-pinout-diagram-01.png)

And the pins are counted like this

Your phone knows how to work with your Bluetooth earpods and your laptop knows how to work with your USB mouse because of standardized protocols.  I2C, SPI and UART are also standardized protocols.

UART or Universal Asynchronous Reciver/Transmitter is a simple protocol for transferring data back and forth between two devices at the same time.  It uses two wires plus possible ground and power lines.  RX/TX are crossed on each side. Meaning RX on sideA goes to TX on sideB. Clocking is set in software via start/stop bits and baud rates.  In microcontroller applications UART is often used by humans for debugging purposes as they have the microcontroller print break points in the code its running to a serial console.

SPI or Serial Peripheral Interface is simple serial protocol that uses four wires plus possible ground and power lines to connect several devices that are a short distance apart together and need rapid data transfer.  Generally one device is condered the master and the rest are considered slaves.  The clock is set with the clock wire and a slave is chosen using the SS wire.  All devices are hooked up in parrallel but require their own SS wire from the master.  MOSI(master out slave in) and MISO(master in slave out) allow data to travel both directions between two devices at the same time. An SPI bus can generally support as many devices as SS pins the microcontroller has.

I2C (pronounced I squared C) is an advanced serial protocol that uses two wires plus possible ground and power lines to connect several devices that are a short distance apart and don't require rapid data transfer.  Generally one device is considered the master and the rest are considered slaves.  The master calls out to a slave via a specific hard coded 7bit device address.  Communications happen one direction at a time and there can be up to 127 slaves hooked up in parrallel on one I2C bus.  Each device is interconnected via a serial data (SDA) and serial clock(SCL) wires.

In addition to supporting the protocols above, the Raspberry Pi also offers GPIO pins.  When working with those signals can either be `digtal` or `analog` and  the data can flow either `in` or `out`.

Digital is either on or off.  Think of a light switch.
Analog is more like what the ocean looks like or what a song looks like in some editing software if you've ever seen that.  Very fluid.

For example, you could build a clap switch.  You could get a sound sensor. It is an digital input to the Raspberry Pi.  When it hears a noise it sends a HIGH signal to the Pi and at that point the Pi has a program written to send a HIGH to a digital output to an LED.  Noise made, light on.  Noise made, light off.

With analaog in and out you use a photoresistor(light sensor) as an input to detect the ambient light in your room and then alter the brightness of an LED via a PWM/analog output on the Pi in proportion to ambient light.


If this kind of stuff interests you, you may want to explore `embedded` engineering.  The type of problems these types of engineers solve and the devices they work with are often quite different from your standard softwared engineer.

Enough talk, lets hook up that LCD screen

- Shutdown your Pi
- Wire the screen like [this](TODO)
- Boot the Pi back up

Now lets print `hello world` on that screen
TODO
install package
write script
execute script

Raise your hand if this didn't work for you and a volunteer will come around and help you out.


Now lets edit the code we wrote yesterday so the title of your blog entry appears on the screen

##Presentation preperation
The ability to articulate and defend your ideas is an important skill to have no matter what field you go into.  A piece of general life advice: learn how to patiently communicate and be assertive.  Truth be told, people don't like making decisions or doing research on their own.  The more you bring to them, the more organized you are in your approach, the more passoinate you are -- the more likely they are to support your position/give you a raise/etc.

When giving a presentation:

- Let your personality, body language and passion speak
- Don't use a script
- Focus on one narrowish topic the whole time
- Avoid "um", "hmm" and similar filler words when possible
- Practice.  Make sure you cover all the high level while finishing in your allocated time
- Keep your slides full of figures, pictures and memes and not walls of text
- Make eye contact
- Focus in on a specific person and look for feedback in their body language
- Be ready for ANY question.  Its ok to say "I don't know"
- Describe shortcomings. Nothing is perfect and it makes you look authentic.
- Do a practice run amongst peers and ask for feedback
- Try not to stress it.  A lot of people will completly tune you out.  Others will have no idea what you are talking about.  People that want to challenge you may opt to do so one-on-one after the talk.

We've pre-created a slide deck for use during our upcoming presentations.

We need TODO volunteers.  These girls will:

- Edit the slide deck to their liking
- Practice amongst themselves and one of the volunteers
- Do a practice run in front of the class and recieve feedback from the class
- Present to the parents
- Present to the whole kickoff audience

Please raise your hand if you are interested.
